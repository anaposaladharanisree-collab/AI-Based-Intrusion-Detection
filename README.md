This repository is hosting an Intrusion Detection System which is an AI-based system that is used to detect malicious network activities with the help of machine learning. 
The project is based on the preprocessing of network traffic data, feature engineering, model training, and performance estimation in order to recognize possible security threats effectively. 
It shows how data analytics and artificial intelligence can be applied in the field of cybersecurity in practice, offering a scalable framework to enhance the processes of network protection. 
Its implementation is appropriate in academic research, learning and as a base to establish more sophisticated intrusion detection solutions.
